- get average final performance by complexity, organization type, bias
select infmatrix, orgtype, increment, bias, min(actualperformance), avg(actualperformance), max(actualperformance) from details where completed = 1 group by infmatrix, orgtype, increment, bias;

- get project completion time (as weighted by the number of neighbors considered during each time period)
select infmatrix, orgType, increment, bias, completedPhaseOne, avg(duration) from durationtotal group by infmatrix, orgType, increment, bias, completedPhaseOne;

- get the totalduration for each organization
select count(*), infmatrix, landscapeID, orgID, orgType, increment, bias, sum(numConsideringNeighbors) from details group by infmatrix, orgType, increment, bias, landscapeID, orgID;
